# PalmVerse: Converting Sign Languages to Audio and Textual Outputs
2024 GT Hacklytics project. Real-time hand sign recognition and vocal output. 


PalmVerse is a cutting-edge project aimed at leveraging computer vision and deep learning models to convert sign languages into audio and textual outputs. Our goal is to make communication more accessible for individuals who use sign languages as their primary means of expression.

## Features

- 🔊 **Real-time Sign Language Translation**: Convert sign language gestures into spoken words and text in real-time.
- 🌐 **Multi-lingual Support**: Support for multiple sign languages, ensuring inclusivity across diverse communities.
- 🎨 **Customizable Outputs**: Options to customize output preferences, including audio voice and language.
- 💻 **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive user interface designed for ease of use by both sign language users and non-users.

## How it Works

1. 📊 **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse dataset of sign language gestures for training the deep learning models.
2. 🛠️ **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the collected data to enhance model performance and generalization.
3. 🧠 **Model Training**: Train deep learning models using computer vision techniques to recognize and interpret sign language gestures.
4. 🔄 **Integration**: Integrate the trained models into the PalmVerse application for real-time translation.
5. 🎙️ **Output Generation**: Convert recognized sign language gestures into audio and textual outputs using the integrated models.
6. 🔄 **Feedback Loop**: Continuously improve model accuracy and performance based on user feedback and additional data.
