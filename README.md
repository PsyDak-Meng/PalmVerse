# PalmVerse: Converting Sign Languages to Audio and Textual Outputs
2024 GT Hacklytics project. Real-time hand sign recognition and vocal output. 

PalmVerse leverages computer vision and deep learning models to convert sign languages into audio and textual outputs. Our goal is to make communication more accessible for individuals who use sign languages as their primary means of expression.
